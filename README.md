It's an NPC generator for 5e DND. Completely FREE and can be run Locally and offline. Just hosting it here as it's my first C++ project and I like having a backup. Feel free to download and change whatever you want, and check out my python version as well it's farther along than this one at the moment.
PYTHON VERSION: https://github.com/vincent-smith309/NPC

DO NOT PAY FOR THIS PROGRAM.

It is a truly Free Software, not Donation Ware, so you should never recieve any adds or popups asking you for money.

Please only download from official links provided by The Fool. If you feel obliged to give me a donation I won't turn it down, but it is not required and the software itself will never prompt you to give a donation.

I have plans to add a "random backstory and appearance generator" that will drop a paragraph about the npcs looks and backstory.

.exe in output folder haven't compiled it on linux yet but if you do I'd appreciate it
If you want to donate please contact me on Discord: thefool309#9194
